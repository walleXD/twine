# Twine

### Useful Commands

- `pnpm build` - Build all packages, including the Storybook site
- `pnpm dev` - Run all packages locally and preview with Storybook
- `pnpm lint` - Lint all packages
- `pnpm changeset` - Generate a changeset
- `pnpm clean` - Clean up all `node_modules` and `dist` folders (runs each package's clean script)

## Turborepo

[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases. It was designed after the workflows used by massive software engineering organizations to ship code at scale. Turborepo abstracts the complex configuration needed for monorepos and provides fast, incremental builds with zero-configuration remote caching.

Using Turborepo simplifies managing your design system monorepo, as you can have a single lint, build, test, and release process for all packages. [Learn more](https://vercel.com/blog/monorepos-are-changing-how-teams-build-software) about how monorepos improve your development workflow.

## Apps & Packages

This Turborepo includes the following packages and applications:

- `packages/@twine/core`: Core React components
- `packages/@twine/utils`: Shared React utilities
- `packages/@twine/tsconfig`: Shared `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the Turborepo
- `packages/eslint-config-twine`: ESLint preset

Each package and app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Workspaces enables us to "hoist" dependencies that are shared between packages to the root `package.json`. This means smaller `node_modules` folders and a better local dev experience. To install a dependency for the entire monorepo, use the `-w` workspaces flag with `pnpm add`.

This example sets up your `.gitignore` to exclude all generated files, other folders like `node_modules` used to store your dependencies.

### Compilation

To make the core library code work across all browsers, we need to compile the raw TypeScript and React code to plain JavaScript. We can accomplish this with `tsup`, which uses `esbuild` to greatly improve performance.

Running `pnpm build` from the root of the Turborepo will run the `build` command defined in each package's `package.json` file. Turborepo runs each `build` in parallel and caches & hashes the output to speed up future builds.

For `twine-core`, the `build` command is the following:

```bash
tsup-node src/index.ts --format esm,cjs --dts
```

`tsup` compiles `src/index.ts`, which exports all of the components in the design system, into both ES Modules and CommonJS formats as well as their TypeScript types. The `package.json` for `twine-core` then instructs the consumer to select the correct format:

```json:twine-core/package.json
{
  "name": "@twine/core",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "main": "./dist/index.js",
  "module": "./dist/index.mjs",
  "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
  "sideEffects": false,
}
```

Run `pnpm build` to confirm compilation is working correctly. You should see a folder `twine-core/dist` which contains the compiled output.

```bash
twine-core
└── dist
    ├── index.d.ts  <-- Types
    ├── index.js    <-- CommonJS version
    └── index.mjs   <-- ES Modules version
```

## Versioning & Publishing Packages

This example uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versions, create changelogs, and publish to npm. It's preconfigured so you can start publishing packages immediately.

You'll need to create an `NPM_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` and add it to your GitHub repository settings to enable access to npm. It's also worth installing the [Changesets bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) on your repository.

### Generating the Changelog

To generate your changelog, run `pnpm changeset` locally:

1. **Which packages would you like to include?** – This shows which packages and changed and which have remained the same. By default, no packages are included. Press `space` to select the packages you want to include in the `changeset`.
2. **Which packages should have a major bump?** – Press `space` to select the packages you want to bump versions for.
3. If doing the first major version, confirm you want to release.
4. Write a summary for the changes.
5. Confirm the changeset looks as expected.
6. A new Markdown file will be created in the `changeset` folder with the summary and a list of the packages included.

### Releasing

When you push your code to GitHub, the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action) will run the `release` script defined in the root `package.json`:

```bash
turbo run build --filter=docs^... && changeset publish
```

Turborepo runs the `build` script for all publishable packages (excluding docs) and publishes the packages to npm. By default, this example includes `twine` as the npm organization. To change this, do the following:

- Rename folders in `packages/*` to replace `twine` with your desired scope
- Search and replace `twine` with your desired scope
- Re-run `pnpm install`

To publish packages to a private npm organization scope, **remove** the following from each of the `package.json`'s

```diff
- "publishConfig": {
-  "access": "public"
- },
```
